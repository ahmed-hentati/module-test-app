# 📌 Slide 1 — Context
### Project Situation Before My Intervention
- CI pipeline was constantly failing  
- Unit tests were broken or outdated  
- Test coverage was too low to ensure reliability  
- Deployment was blocked because the pipeline could not pass  

---

# 📌 Slide 2 — My Role
### What I Took Ownership Of
- Performed a full audit of the test suite  
- Fixed broken or unstable tests  
- Refactored critical test setups  
- Restored pipeline stability  
- Defined a clean testing strategy  

---

# 📌 Slide 3 — Key Achievements
### Quantitative Impact
- 📈 **Raised unit test coverage to ~60%**  
- 🧪 **Added +800 new tests**  
- 📂 **193 files now covered or validated**  
- 🚦 **Pipeline now succeeds consistently**, unlocking deployments  
- 🔄 Strong improvement of reliability, stability, and code quality  

---

# 📌 Slide 4 — Technical Improvements
### What Was Done Concretely
- Fixed failing suites caused by outdated mocks, wrong imports, async issues  
- Standardized Jest/TestBed patterns to ensure consistency  
- Cleaned up unused or flaky tests  
- Improved Jest configuration (moduleNameMapper, tsconfig paths, setup files)  
- CI refinements: caching + isolated test environment + stability fixes  

---

# 📌 Slide 5 — Business Value
### Why It Matters
- Teams can now **deploy without blockers**  
- Reduced risk of regressions  
- More predictable delivery cycles  
- Higher maintainability for future features  
- Increased trust from QA & stakeholders  

---

# 📌 Slide 6 — Next Steps
### To Keep the Momentum
- Enforce minimum coverage thresholds per module  
- Add a testing strategy to onboarding documentation  
- Extend tests to complex business workflows  
- Continuous CI improvement and monitoring  

---

# 📌 Slide 7 — Summary
### A Stable, Reliable, and Deployable Frontend
- Pipeline fixed  
- Coverage boosted to **60%**  
- **+800 tests added**  
- **193 files validated**  
- Deployment workflow unblocked and stable

## 🎤 30-Second Pitch
> “When I joined the project, the CI pipeline was failing and deployments were blocked.  
> I took ownership of the test ecosystem, fixed all failing tests, added over 800 new ones, and raised coverage to 60%.  
> Today, the pipeline succeeds consistently, deployments are unblocked, and the codebase is much more stable and maintainable.”
